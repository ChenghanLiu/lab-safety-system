- Build monolith: Spring Boot 3.x backend + Vue 3 frontend (frontend later).
- Always enforce RBAC (STUDENT/TEACHER/ADMIN) on every endpoint.
- Use Flyway migrations and MySQL.
- Implement reservation conflict rules and write tests for them.
- Keep MVP demo-friendly: seed minimal data and provide simple API docs via Swagger.
